        <p class="about-content">Sigh, another tech blogâ€¦ Alas, it is. BUT, this is my corner of the internet and BradyOnTech is a space for me to transfer my thoughts and learnings, primarily revolving around programming and technology. </p>
        <p class="about-content"></p>
        <p class="about-content">I'm a self-taught developer and I know the struggle of learning to program. The premise of my vision for this site is to provide <u>over-explained</u> and <u>useful</u> tutorials and posts. I understand the rabbit hole that learning to program can spur. My goal is to fully explain every aspect, so if you embrace the learning process, you won't leave wondering <i>"How in the world does this bit of code actually work?"</i>.</p>
        <p class="about-content">So thanks for coming to BradyOnTech! I'm Brady, and I designed and developed this site because I'm passionate about programming, learning, teaching, and technology. 
            I'm based out of Denver, Colorado by way of the great state of Iowa. If you're looking for my resume, you can find that <a id="about-resume-link" href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.
            I hope you enjoy the content I create. If you have any questions about anything, please feel free to contact me at any of the social media accounts located in the footer.
